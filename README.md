## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Component Hierarchy
```
App.tsx (Root)
├── LandingPage.tsx
├── PRDGenerator.tsx
├── Templates.tsx
├── Dashboard.tsx
└── PRDOutput.tsx
```

### State Management
- **Local State**: React useState for form data and UI state
- **Props Drilling**: Simple prop passing for component communication
- **No External State Library**: Keeps the application lightweight and focused

### Data Flow
1. User inputs scenario details in PRDGenerator
2. Form data is processed and structured
3. AI simulation generates comprehensive PRD sections
4. PRD is displayed in PRDOutput with export options
5. Users can save PRDs to local state for dashboard access

## 📋 PRD Structure

Each generated PRD includes the following sections:

### Core Sections
- **Title**: Auto-generated from problem statement
- **Problem Statement**: User-defined scenario description
- **Target Audience**: Specific user groups and personas
- **Objectives & Goals**: Measurable outcomes and success criteria

### Detailed Sections
- **User Stories**: Structured user scenarios and requirements
- **Features & Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear definition of done
- **Metrics of Success**: KPIs and measurable outcomes
- **Risks & Dependencies**: Potential challenges and constraints

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Blue (#2563eb) - CTAs and primary actions
- **Secondary**: Gray (#6b7280) - Text and secondary elements
- **Success**: Green (#10b981) - Positive actions and confirmations
- **Warning**: Yellow (#f59e0b) - Risks and important notices
- **Error**: Red (#ef4444) - Critical issues and problems

### Typography
- **Headings**: Bold, clear hierarchy with proper spacing
- **Body Text**: Readable font sizes with 150% line height
- **Code/Technical**: Monospace font for technical elements

### Layout Principles
- **8px Grid System**: Consistent spacing throughout
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first approach
- **White Space**: Generous spacing for readability
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear content organization

## 🎯 User Workflows

### Primary Workflow: Create New PRD
1. **Landing Page**: User learns about the tool and clicks "Start Writing a PRD"
2. **Generator Form**: User fills in scenario details (problem, audience, goals, features, constraints)
3. **AI Generation**: System processes input and generates structured PRD
4. **Review & Export**: User reviews generated PRD, makes edits, and exports/saves

### Template Workflow
1. **Template Selection**: User browses template library
2. **Template Application**: Selected template pre-fills the generator form
3. **Customization**: User modifies template content for their specific scenario
4. **Generation**: Standard PRD generation process continues

### Dashboard Workflow
1. **Access Saved PRDs**: User views previously created and saved PRDs
2. **Management Actions**: Download, view, or organize existing PRDs
3. **Statistics**: View usage patterns and productivity metrics

## 🔧 Development
